# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MedSync application is experiencing critical authentication failures due to database schema mismatches and error handling issues. The primary issue is that the `patients` table lacks the `password_hash` column that the application code expects, causing 500 Internal Server Errors during patient login attempts. This spec addresses the need to align the database schema with the application code, implement proper error handling, and ensure smooth authentication flows for all user types (staff and patients).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Schema Alignment

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database schema to match the application code expectations, so that authentication and data operations work correctly without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application attempts to access the `password_hash` column in the `patients` table THEN the database SHALL have this column available
2. WHEN the database schema is updated THEN existing patient records SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN new columns are added THEN they SHALL have appropriate data types and constraints matching the Sequelize model definitions
4. IF the `patients` table is missing authentication-related columns THEN the system SHALL add `password_hash` (VARCHAR(255)), `last_login` (TIMESTAMP), and `is_active` (BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE)
5. WHEN schema migrations are applied THEN the system SHALL log the changes for audit purposes

### Requirement 2: Patient Authentication Error Handling

**User Story:** As a patient, I want to receive clear error messages when login fails, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a patient login fails due to database errors THEN the system SHALL return a user-friendly error message instead of exposing internal errors
2. WHEN a patient attempts to login without a password set THEN the system SHALL return a specific error message indicating password setup is required
3. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL return a 503 Service Unavailable error with appropriate messaging
4. WHEN a patient provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized error without revealing whether the email or password was incorrect
5. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information server-side for debugging while returning sanitized errors to clients

### Requirement 3: Staff Authentication Error Handling

**User Story:** As a staff member, I want reliable authentication that handles edge cases gracefully, so that I can access the system without unexpected errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN staff login encounters database errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with appropriate error responses
2. WHEN a staff account is inactive THEN the system SHALL return a specific error message indicating the account status
3. WHEN staff authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log the attempt for security auditing
4. IF the `users` table has schema mismatches THEN the system SHALL identify and fix them
5. WHEN staff password reset is requested THEN the system SHALL validate the user exists before processing

### Requirement 4: Database Connection Resilience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to handle database connection issues gracefully, so that temporary network issues don't crash the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
2. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
3. WHEN the database is unavailable during startup THEN the system SHALL wait and retry connection instead of crashing
4. WHEN connection pool is exhausted THEN the system SHALL queue requests and return timeout errors after 30 seconds
5. WHEN database health checks fail THEN the system SHALL log warnings and alert administrators

### Requirement 5: Frontend Error Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear, actionable error messages in the UI, so that I know what went wrong and what to do next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests return 500 errors THEN the frontend SHALL display a generic "Something went wrong" message with a retry option
2. WHEN API requests return 401 errors THEN the frontend SHALL redirect to the login page
3. WHEN API requests return 503 errors THEN the frontend SHALL display a "Service temporarily unavailable" message
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the frontend SHALL display a "Connection error" message with retry option
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the frontend SHALL display the specific error message from the API response

### Requirement 6: Logging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging of authentication attempts and errors, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any authentication attempt occurs THEN the system SHALL log the timestamp, user identifier, IP address, and result
2. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the full error stack trace server-side
3. WHEN authentication fails multiple times from the same IP THEN the system SHALL log a security warning
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL include request context (headers, body) in logs
5. WHEN errors are logged THEN sensitive information (passwords, tokens) SHALL be redacted

### Requirement 7: Data Migration Safety

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want schema changes to be applied safely, so that no data is lost during migrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schema migrations are executed THEN the system SHALL create a backup of affected tables first
2. WHEN adding new columns THEN the system SHALL use ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN with appropriate defaults
3. WHEN migrations fail THEN the system SHALL rollback changes automatically
4. WHEN migrations complete THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity
5. WHEN existing patient records lack password_hash THEN the system SHALL set them to NULL and flag accounts for password setup
